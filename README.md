# Front-end Engineer // Challenger Bank // London React // Competitive Salary

Who wants to work for a challenger bank?!

The UK’s oldest P2P lending platform have just obtained their banking license and are moving the product in a different direction. They’ll still have their initial platform, but are now looking for React engineers to work across the new banking sector.

This will involve personal finance management (setting spending limits, saving targets, spending trends etc.), credit cards with low APR and no fees, as well as a current account style bank. They’re looking to launch this on V1 at the beginning of 2018; the majority of the back-end is built, but need an engineer with React exp. to join the party. The overall aim would be to centralise this platform and create an overall hub, for personal banking, lendors and investors. As well as this, they’re going to focus heavily on customer experience and how each decision affects the end user.

It's React focused in a TDD environment, and potentially give you some experience with React Native if you fancied it. They're also working with Webpack, Sass, and Styled-Components in the front-end.

They offer a 10% bonus, and equity, and they're looking to IPO in the near future, so the shares would actually be worth something.

Please submit your details for more information about this opportunity.
